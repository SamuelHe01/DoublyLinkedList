# Library Sorting
The objective of the project is to create a sorted library of books by sorting them into a vector of size 26, with each vector index corresponding to an alphabetical character.
The end goal is to create functions to create, delete, and query the a library object. Each library object has 26 records, with each record holding a variable amount of books, the number of which depends on the user input.
